    IMPORTANT: This APWorld uses a hub-based region structure.
    The Hub (well area) is the starting location.
    
    Access Requirements:
    - Hub: Always accessible (starting area)
    - Garden: Requires "Garden Access"
    - High Street: Requires "High Street Access"
    - Back Gardens: Requires "Back Gardens Access"
    - Pub: Requires "Pub Access"
    - Model Village: Requires "Pub Access" + "Model Village Access" (accessed through Pub)
    
    Victory Requirements:
    - "Complete the game" requires ALL 5 access items because the player must
      carry the golden bell back through every area to the starting pond.
    
    All items, drags, and goals in a region inherit that region's
    access requirement automatically.
