A multiworld randomizer client for Untitled Goose Game using the Archipelago framework.

## Overview

This mod turns Untitled Goose Game into an Archipelago multiworld game where:

### Gameplay Changes

#### Area Progression
In vanilla Goose Game, areas unlock automatically as you progress. With AP:
- You start with 1 **Random Area** unlocked or whatever was chosen in the yaml
- If you try to enter an area that you do not have access to you will be warped to the Hub area (Well)
- **High Street**, **Gardens**, **Back Gardens**, **Pub**, and **Model Village** require AP items
- Complete goals to send checks and receive items from the multiworld

#### Goals = Locations
Every goal on your to-do list is a location check:
- Complete "Rake in the lake" → Send check → Maybe unlock someone else's item!
- Someone completes their check → You might receive "High Street Access"!

## Location List (282 checks)
Actually too many to list now.
